# SpaceX API Capstone Project

## Overview

This Data Science Capstone Project focuses on analyzing data related to SpaceX missions, specifically the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage landing success. The project involves data collection through SpaceX API, web scraping using BeautifulSoup, data wrangling, SQL database interaction, data visualization using Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly Dash, as well as machine learning to predict the success of the first stage landing.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Utilize SpaceX API to gather detailed information about Falcon 9 missions.
   - Web scrape additional data using BeautifulSoup from relevant web sources.

2. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Clean and preprocess collected data.
   - Handle missing values, data inconsistencies, and format conversion.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Store cleaned data in a SQL database for efficient data retrieval and management.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilize Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly Dash for visually exploring and presenting insights from the data.

5. **Machine Learning:**
   - Employ machine learning algorithms to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.
   - Train and evaluate models using historical data.

## Dependencies
